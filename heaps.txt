A binary heap is a complete binary tree in which every node satisfies the heap property which states that: 

.............................(MAX - HEAP).........................................        
               1.)If (B) is a child of (A), then key(A) â‰¥ key(B)
               2.)The root node has the highest key value in the heap 

.................................................................................



 That is, if an element is at position i in the array, then its left child is stored at position 2i and its right child at position 2i+1. Conversely, an element at position i has its parent stored at position i/2.
